# Software Quality - CSC 385

This repository is dedicated to the project developed for the course Software Quality (CSC 385). The main aim of this project was to create a Quality Management Plan (QMP) for our CSC 380 project.

## What is a Quality Management Plan (QMP)?

A Quality Management Plan is a vital component of any project management plan. The QMP outlines the necessary information required to effectively manage project quality from project planning to delivery. It defines the desired quality standards, quality control and assurance activities, and quality roles and responsibilities. The plan acts as a guideline for the project team to follow to maintain the desired level of quality throughout the project.

## Project Structure

- **Control Flow Diagrams**: These diagrams provide a detailed view of the system's code, including the interactions in the system, their attributes, operations, and the relationships among objects.
  
- **State Machine Diagrams**: These diagrams depict the various states that objects in the system can have, along with the transitions between those states.
  
These diagrams help in understanding the various components of the system and how they interact with each other. They form an integral part of the QMP, providing visual representations of many aspects of the software system.

## Quality Management Plan (QMP) Documents

The key QMP requirements for our project can be found in the `Project Assignments` folder. These documents outline the standards and procedures set for the project to ensure the high quality of the software. It also provides the criteria for the acceptance of deliverables and the methods to be used for monitoring and controlling quality throughout the project.

**Note:** The completed Quality Management Plan (QMP) is also present in this repository. It represents the culmination of our work in this project and serves as a tangible demonstration of our understanding and application of software quality principles.

This repository is a comprehensive resource on the application of quality management principles in software development. It provides valuable insights into planning, managing, and controlling quality in a software project.
